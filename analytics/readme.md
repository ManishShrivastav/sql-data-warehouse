# üìä Analytics & Reporting Layer ‚Äî Product & Customer Insights

This module extends the existing **Data Warehouse project** by introducing two analytical views in the **`gold` layer**, designed to provide a business-friendly summary of key metrics and behaviors.

These reports enable fast insights for stakeholders and serve as a foundation for BI dashboards, performance tracking, and segmentation analysis.

üìÑ **View defined in:** [`report_customers.sql`](./report_customers.sql)

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Notes

Both views follow a consistent pattern:
1. **Base Query**: Join fact and dimension tables to gather relevant transactional and entity data.
2. **Aggregation**: Group by key (product or customer) to summarize metrics.
3. **Final Output**: Add calculated KPIs and segment classifications.

---

## üß± Dependencies

These views depend on the following existing tables in the `gold` schema:

- `gold.fact_sales`
- `gold.dim_products`
- `gold.dim_customers`

Ensure these base tables are populated before running the views.

---

## üöÄ How to Use

1. Place the `.sql` files in your repository (e.g., in `analytics/` folder).
2. Execute each script in your SQL environment:
   ```sql
   CREATE VIEW gold.report_products AS ...
   CREATE VIEW gold.report_customers AS ...
